# Video Face Clustering - GitHub Repository

## Overview

Welcome to the Video Face Clustering repository! This project addresses the challenging task of clustering faces in videos, considering methodological and computational complexities. The developed algorithm aims to reduce the computational complexity of matching and verifying similar faces in an unsupervised learning manner. The primary application focuses on processing TV videos to detect and identify celebrity faces, presenting the results through a statistics dashboard.

## Technologies Used

- **OpenCV:** A computer vision library for image and video processing.
- **MTCNN (Multi-Task Cascaded Convolutional Networks):** A deep learning-based face detection algorithm.
- **FaceNet:** A deep learning model for face recognition and feature extraction.
- **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise):** An unsupervised clustering algorithm suitable for high-dimensional data.
- **Flask:** A web framework used for creating the statistics dashboard.

## Project Structure

- **`Encodings/`**: Contains saved facial embeddings generated by the FaceNet model.
- **`ClusteredFaces/`**: Stores images grouped by clusters, as identified by the clustering algorithm (DBSCAN).
- **`dashboard/`**: Houses files related to the Flask-based web application for real-time updates and statistics visualization.
- **`Frames/`**: Holds individual frames extracted from video sources for face detection and feature extraction processes.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/video-face-clustering.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the application: `python main.py`

## Usage

1. Run face detection using MTCNN.
2. Extract facial features using FaceNet.
3. Perform clustering using DBSCAN.
4. Explore the real-time updates on the Flask dashboard.
